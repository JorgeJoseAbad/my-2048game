# my-2048game
Ironhack bootcamp 2048 game

The goal of the game is to get the number 2048 using additions of the number 2 and its multiples. 
The user starts with a 4x4 grid, that initially contains two tiles that can have just two different values: 2 or 4.

The user moves the tiles in any direction with the objective of joining two numbers with the same value.

After each player move, the game will generate a new tile with value 2 or 4, and will place it in a random position in the board. 
By merging tiles into higher numbers, the user will get closer to the 2048.

The game is over when there arenâ€™t valid moves available. 
This happens when you have the board full of tiles and none of them can be merged.
